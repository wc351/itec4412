### Fall 2014 - ITEC 4412 - Intermediate Webmaster

One of the primary goals of this class is for students to gain experience working on a project with others in Github.  We will be discussing different project ideas and building groups from there.  Each group will ideally have three members.  Good in code documentation, quality commit messages and use of pull requests will be critical to executing a successful project.  In order for students to get the most out of the course the projects will need to to be something that students are interested in working on.  We are looking to begin a discussion on what the projects will be.  In order to get things started we are offering the following projects for discussion.  Feel free to propose your own ideas (you can submit a pull request on this document right on the GitHub page) or discuss them in the related issue thread.

### Suggestions for projects

#### 1. GIS Project Hosting
For this project the students will build a web page that can display projects that have been completed by any GIS student. The page will allow users to view projects; this will allow students to display their work for future employers. If an account is created then the users can download the project map from the website. They can upload their project to the page, when the project is uploaded it will be the completed map and the user can add a brief description of the map. 

#### 2. Sensor Network
We will be learning how to set up raspberry pis with sensors that feed data into a database.  A project could be designed around a set of raspberry pis collecting data that is then used in a web application.  Examples might be collecting temperature data and feeding it into a map.


#### 3. Interactive Campus Map
For this project the students will build a web page that can be used by any student on campus to find the location where they are currently and display the buildings on campus. This web page will be interactive meaning that the users will see the map based on them being a normal size on the map and not a large dot. The web page will also be responsive so that no matter what device the user has they can see the web page properly. Users will need to be able to search for buildings or teachers and be shown how to reach them.

#### 4. Lake Data Project
For this project students will start version two of an existing web project. The students will be building adding a download function to the charts page, an update function for different data or time for the charts page. A data entry page will be created that allows for the manual entry of data as well as uploading of a spread sheet. The site will need to be made responsive as well. 

#### 5. Student Suggested Projects
What ideas do you have for a project? The project requires; a GIS aspect (map, location data, etc.), use of Django, and must be built in stages and up loaded to a group repository throughout the length of the project.
